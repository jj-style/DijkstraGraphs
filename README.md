# DijkstraGraphs
Simple graph creating software which can be traversed using my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python.  
  
[graph_structure.py](graph_structure.py) can be used to create a simple graph.  
Left click to create a node - it is named automatically  
Right click on 2 nodes, then enter a number and press enter to join them  
Hover the mouse over a node and press 'f' to flag the node as the starting node  
Press enter to run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph (must have [DijkstraFinder.py](DijkstraFinder.py) in the same directory)  
Press 's' to save an image of your graph.
