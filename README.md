# DijkstraGraphs
Simple graph creating software which can be traversed using my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python.  
  
How to create a simple graph:  
Left click to create a node - it is named automatically  
Right click on 2 nodes, then enter a number and press 'enter' to join them  
Hover the mouse over a node and press 'f' to flag the node as the starting node  
Press 'enter' to run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph   
Press 's' to save an image of your graph.  
  
Note:  
Output of Dijkstra's algorithm is destination node,shortest distance to destination node, route to destination node  
(See in screenshot below)
